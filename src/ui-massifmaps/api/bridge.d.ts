 * The one place the surface API touches a platform.
 *
 * Everything above this is shared: the C++ facade is six verbs over strings and numbers, so the
 * only per-platform work is reaching the generated `MassifApi` class, keeping a director alive,
 * and turning a blob or a flat double array into something JavaScript can hold.
 *
 * Nothing here is typed against the generated SDK typings on purpose. `com.massifmaps.api` and
 * `MSFMassifApi` do not exist in `src/ui-massifmaps/typings` yet - those are regenerated from a
 * built SDK (`npm run typings.android` / `typings.ios`), and declaring the classes by hand here
 * would collide with them the moment they do. The bridge looks them up at runtime instead.
